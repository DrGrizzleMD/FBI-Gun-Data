    ">Today, the topic of gun ownership is considered a controversial and wide-ranging topic in the United States.  Many are calling for gun registration laws to be tighter while others say there is no issue to be had, it is merely a part of our culture.  Regardless of your personal opinion on the matter, one this is for certain.  We have to learn more about this topic to be able to have informed discussions about this with eachother.  That is why I chose this dataset to examine, to try and gather some perspective on gun ownership as it pertains to our population metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    ">I aim to use this information to open conversations about this topic and scientifically understand a part of this issue using data-driven conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The data is provided in two files.  The first is an excel file from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS.  The NICS is used to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to purchase firearms or explosives.  Gun shops will use this system to ensure that the buyer does not have a criminal record or is otherwise ineligible to purchase the items.  The second is a CSV file that contains state level data provided by U.S. Census Bureau (census.gov).\n",

    "### The questions I will be answering today are:<br/>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li><b> Does having a college degree correlate with gun ownership? </b><br/></li>\n",
    "    <li><b> Is there an association between a state's foreign born population percentage and high gun registrations?</b><br/></li>\n",
    "    <li><b> What was the state with the highest amount of gun ownership per capita in 2016?  </b><br/></li>\n",

Since Kentucky has more than three and a half times more gun registrations per capita than its next-in-line, I would say that further analysis could be done on why that is so different compared to the rest of the US.  Analysis could be done on the state-level gun laws to determine a factor.  Some things to consider/investigate would be the number of gun shows within state lines, gun regulations regarding selling/trading of firearms and length of waiting period for background checks."

    "  <li>Question Two: With the exception of the Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander group, almost all of the correlation coefficients ranged from .31-.36. This could indicate that there is no significant correlation between gun ownership totals and ancestry percentage as a whole. </li>\n",
    "  <li>Question Three: The State of Kentucky has the highest Gun Registrations per Capita of any state in the U.S.  This is by a wide margin, as well.  I would recommend further research into such a distinctive outlier.  More lenient laws regarding firearms/explosives in Kentucky could be an easy cause for such a vast difference with the other states.</li>\n",
